# CSRF Issue using Japa

Currently, when an API call is made from a method that uses CSRF within the Japa test suite, the error ```Invalid or expired CSRF token``` appears. Try to isolate the error, as I am using CSRF, method spoofing, and login within my project. I attempted to isolate the error. I reached this minimal configuration where the error occurs.
